          <h3>How to Create a Outreach Video</h3>
          <p>By:Our Fearless Leader</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the age of the Internet and Social Media it’s fairly easy to
            Google keywords or phrases and find hundreds of related articles,
            images, and videos. So why is it so hard to find instructions on how
            to create an effective educational outreach video? Is it some sort
            of best-kept marketing secret? I typed “how to create an effective
            educational outreach video” into the Google search bar and only two
            relevant results popped up. In the words of one of Gav’s Math
            instructors, that means…more work. Thanks Google. So I did my
            research and watched a bunch of educational videos about small-scale
            gardening, black holes, climate change, and the social hierarchy of
            elephants. In the following paragraphs, I’ll do my best to highlight
            some important elements of an effective educational outreach video
            based on my pretty amateur internet sleuthing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Without delving into all the
            <a href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.16-03-0125"
              >science</a
            >
            (it’s a lot), there are generally four elements that influence the
            effectiveness of an educational outreach video. These are duration,
            format, visual (aides & references), and audio. For a really
            comprehensive deep-dive into elements like best speaking rate and
            vocal cues, see
            <a href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.16-03-0125"
              >this paper</a
            >
            by Cynthia J. Brame, published in the Life Sciences Education
            Journal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Duration. 2 to 6 minutes is the sweet-spot. Brame specifies that
            each video should be less than or equal to 6 minutes in length. This
            was confirmed by the only other relevant google search result. It’s
            a paper by a group of undergrads and professors from the University
            of Arizona who conducted a
            <a href="https://www.capjournal.org/issues/24/24_32.pdf">project</a>
            to create astronomy-related educational videos. They found that 2-6
            minutes was satisfactory. Apparently, anything longer than that is
            just an invitation to nap.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Format. For many informative, “what is…” videos, the general format
            is the following: brief description of what it is, a comparison to
            something similar, pros and cons, some sort of enlightening
            conclusion, a continuous theme to keep everything gelled together.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Visual. Visual aides in these types of videos are used to emphasize,
            summarize, relate, organize, or illustrate important ideas. Types of
            important visual aids include: Diagrams to describe relationship of
            ideas Pictures to represent ideas or illustrate text or audio
            explanation Short videos to illustrate ideas, how-to, etc.. Videos
            of a narrator Pop up text
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Audio. If you’re an introvert or generally a private person, the
            following is bad news. In every educational outreach video I’ve
            seen, there is always a narrator. Always. Time to invest in a great
            quality voice changer or bribe an extravert to do the job! So here
            are the important audio elements to include: Narrator Appropriate
            background sound to emphasize or illustrate Sound from included
            short videos Limited background music/sounds
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That’s it! We’re all set to create educational outreach videos and
            take over the world!
          </p>

          <h3>The Official, Boring, Not-Fun Description of the Project:</h3>
          <p>By:Our Fearless Leader</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            GEAR Club’s Smart Sustainable Garden Project (SSGP) is a
            synchronized group effort to create a proof-of-concept mobile garden
            utilizing a suite of sensors and associated app to help increase the
            efficiency of the garden. The SSGP is currently in Phase 1 of its
            3-phase lifecycle. In Phase 1 the club is working to develop a
            smart, sustainable proof-of-concept garden for a future large-scale
            version at Gavilan. In Phase 2 we will build the large-scale garden
            (this will require the involvement of the administration at Gavilan
            College). Our club and Gavilan’s Student Government are planning to
            raise the funds for Phase 2 in the next three academic years. In
            Phase 3 we will invite Gavilan’s community to use the garden and
            help us maintain it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In its current phase, the SSGP focuses on four major components:
            Sustainability Garden Design & Construction App Design &
            Construction Education & Outreach
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first component, Sustainability, is applied throughout the
            entire project to include the remaining three components. It carries
            enormous weight in decisions on material, design, construction, and
            location. The project aims to have the least negative impact on the
            environment as possible, given our resource and time constraint.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The second component, Garden Design & Construction, is governed by
            the first component as stated above. It involves research, problem
            scoping, scaling, modeling, constructing CAD designs, 3-D printing,
            testing, and actually building the garden.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The third component, App Design & Construction is primarily focused
            on building code to interface with the sensor suite and turning that
            code into something user-friendly for current and future
            garden-caretakers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The fourth component, Education & Outreach not only refers to the
            education of others but also to the education of the team. This
            component involves research, presentations, discussions, networking,
            website-building, writing, and community-building activities.
          </p>
